# Welcome to Winkky Farms

Where innovation meets tradition, and sometimes farmers become ballroom dancers.

## Our Story

Winkky Farms began in 1980 with one man's vision and continues today with a surprising twist that perfectly captures the spirit of following your dreams.

### The Uncle Dick Era (1980-2010s)

In 1980, Uncle Dick Winkky looked at this piece of land and saw possibility. Along with his brother, he started what would become the heart of our farming operation. But Uncle Dick wasn't interested in conventional farming - he had his own ideas about how things should be done.

**The Pig Whisperer**

Uncle Dick's specialty was pigs, but not just any pigs. While most farmers were moving toward industrial confinement systems, Uncle Dick went the opposite direction. He raised his pigs Swedish-style - free-roaming, happy, and healthy. No farrowing crates, no concrete floors, just pigs being pigs in open pastures and comfortable shelters.

"Happy pigs make better bacon," Uncle Dick would say, and he was right.

**The Local Food Pioneer**

Before "farm-to-table" was trendy, Uncle Dick was practicing it. He fed his pigs exclusively on local grains that he ground himself, mixed with produce that didn't sell at the local farmers market. Nothing went to waste - bruised apples, day-old bread, slightly wilted vegetables all became premium pig feed.

This wasn't just economical; it was revolutionary. Uncle Dick was creating a closed-loop system that supported local farmers, reduced waste, and produced some of the best pork in the county.

**Community Partnerships**

Uncle Dick understood that farming is a community effort. He worked closely with local dairy farmers, growing corn, alfalfa, straw, and hay. These partnerships strengthened the entire agricultural community and created relationships that lasted decades.

And then there were the bees. Uncle Dick's honey operation started small but grew into something special. His hives produced honey that captured the essence of our local wildflowers and farm crops - liquid gold that told the story of our land.

### The Great Transition

After decades of building Winkky Farms into a thriving operation, Uncle Dick made an announcement that surprised everyone: he was retiring from farming to pursue ballroom dancing.

Yes, you read that right. The man who spent 30+ years raising pigs and growing crops traded his overalls for dancing shoes and never looked back. Uncle Dick proved that it's never too late to follow a new passion, and his graceful exit from farming was as unconventional as his approach to agriculture.

### The New Chapter (2010s-Present)

When Uncle Dick hung up his farming boots, we faced a choice: continue his large-scale operation or chart a new course. We chose evolution over replication.

**Scaling Back, Scaling Up**

We've scaled back on the livestock and large corn operations that defined Uncle Dick's era. But we haven't scaled back on our commitment to sustainable, community-focused agriculture. Instead, we're branching out into homestead-style subsistence farming that honors Uncle Dick's innovative spirit while meeting modern needs.

**The Homestead Vision**

Today's Winkky Farms is about:
- **Diversified production** that feeds our family first, community second
- **Sustainable practices** that build soil health and support biodiversity
- **Educational opportunities** that share farming knowledge with the next generation
- **Community connections** that strengthen our local food system

We're growing vegetables for our farm stand, raising chickens for eggs, and maintaining the gardens that Uncle Dick would recognize but with our own modern twist.

### Uncle Dick's Legacy

Uncle Dick's influence runs deeper than the infrastructure he built. He taught us that:
- **Innovation matters more than convention**
- **Happy animals produce better food**
- **Community partnerships make everyone stronger**
- **It's never too late to pursue your passions**
- **Farming is about stewardship, not just production**

Every time we make a decision about the farm, we ask: "What would Uncle Dick do?" Usually, the answer involves thinking outside the box, prioritizing animal welfare, and finding creative solutions to common problems.

### Dancing Into the Future

Uncle Dick may have traded farming for the dance floor, but his spirit lives on at Winkky Farms. We're still innovating, still prioritizing sustainability, and still believing that farming should be about more than just production.

As we plan for farm tours, educational classes, and new ways to connect with our community, we're following Uncle Dick's example: be willing to try something new, do it with passion, and never be afraid to dance to your own rhythm.

**From pig farming to ballroom dancing, from large-scale agriculture to homestead subsistence - Winkky Farms has always been about following your passion and doing things the right way, even if it's not the conventional way.**

## What We Do Today

### Current Operations
- **Vegetable production** for our farm stand and family table
- **Free-range chickens** for fresh eggs
- **Seasonal crops** including sweet corn, tomatoes, and herbs
- **Container gardening** using innovative growing methods

### Future Plans

- **Growing kit production** to help others start their own gardens
- **Community partnerships** continuing Uncle Dick's collaborative spirit

## Our Philosophy

We believe that farming is about more than production - it's about stewardship, community, and connection to the land. Whether we're teaching a gardening class, selling vegetables at our farm stand, or simply tending our own gardens, we're guided by Uncle Dick's example of innovation, sustainability, and following your passion.
