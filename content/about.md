# Three Generations, One Love for the Land

Winkky Farms has been in our family since 1952, when Great-Grandpa Joe bought these 80 acres with dreams bigger than his bank account and a work ethic that could move mountains. Today, three generations later, we're still here - still farming, still learning, still falling in love with this land every sunrise.

## Our Story

**The Beginning (1950s)**  
Great-Grandpa Joe and Great-Grandma Ruth started with nothing but determination and a handful of chickens. They built the original farmhouse with their own hands, cleared fields stone by stone, and established the foundation that we build on today.

**Growing Roots (1970s-90s)**  
Grandpa Bill expanded the operation, adding our first dairy cows and establishing the vegetable gardens that still feed our family. He's the one who taught us that "the land will take care of you if you take care of the land."

**The New Generation (2000s-Today)**  
Now it's our turn. We're blending traditional farming wisdom with modern sustainable practices, raising our own kids to understand where food comes from and why it matters.

## What We Grow

**üåΩ Field Crops**  
- Corn (sweet corn for the family, field corn for the animals)
- Soybeans 
- Hay for our livestock and neighbors

**ü•ï Gardens**  
- Vegetable garden that feeds us year-round
- Herb garden (Grandma's recipes require fresh herbs!)
- Small orchard with apples, pears, and berries

**üêÑ Livestock**  
- Small herd of beef cattle
- Chickens for eggs and meat
- A couple of pigs (best bacon you'll ever taste)
- The world's most spoiled barn cats

## Our Philosophy

We're not trying to be the biggest farm or make the most money. We're trying to be good stewards of this land, raise healthy food, and maintain a way of life that's increasingly rare.

**Sustainable doesn't mean perfect** - it means constantly learning and improving.  
**Traditional doesn't mean backwards** - it means respecting what works.  
**Family doesn't mean just blood** - it means community.

## Why We Share Our Story

Because farming can feel lonely sometimes, and we've learned that sharing our experiences - the triumphs, the failures, the everyday moments - helps us all learn and grow.

Whether you're a fellow farmer, someone thinking about homesteading, or just curious about where your food comes from, you're welcome here.
