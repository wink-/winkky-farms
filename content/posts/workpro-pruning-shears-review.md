# The Tool That's in My Pocket Every Day

If you spend any time around Winkky Farms, you'll notice I always have a pair of pruning shears clipped to my belt or in my back pocket. After going through several brands over the years, I've been using these [WORKPRO pruning shears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DMV6F4WL/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3P56LYOG94570&psc=1) for the past 18 months, and they've become my go-to tool for daily farm tasks.

Here's what I've learned after putting them through real-world farm use.

## What I Use Them For

These shears see action almost every day:
- **Tomato harvesting** during peak season (July-September)
- **Herb cutting** for the farm stand and kitchen
- **Deadheading flowers** in our pollinator gardens
- **Small branch pruning** on fruit trees
- **Vegetable harvesting** (peppers, eggplant, okra)
- **Rose maintenance** around the farmhouse
- **Emergency repairs** (cutting zip ties, rope, etc.)

## First Impressions: Out of the Box

The build quality immediately stood out. These feel substantial in your hand - not flimsy like some budget shears, but not unnecessarily heavy either. The grip has a nice texture that doesn't slip when your hands are dirty or wet (which is most of the time on a farm).

The safety lock is easy to operate with one hand, which matters when you're carrying a harvest basket and need to quickly secure the tool.

## 18 Months Later: The Real Test

### **Blade Performance: Excellent**
The blades have stayed sharp through constant use. I've cut everything from delicate herb stems to 3/4-inch apple branches, and they still make clean cuts. No crushing or tearing that damages plants.

**Sharpening**: I've touched them up twice with a simple sharpening stone - takes about 5 minutes and they're like new.

### **Durability: Impressive**
These have been dropped on concrete, left out in rain (oops), and used for tasks they probably weren't designed for. The only wear I see is some paint wearing off the handles where my hands grip them most.

**No failures**: Springs still work perfectly, lock mechanism is solid, no loose parts.

### **Comfort: All-Day Usable**
During tomato harvest season, I might use these for 3-4 hours straight. The ergonomic design really shows - no hand fatigue or cramping like I experienced with my old shears.

**Grip texture**: Still provides good traction even when wet or muddy.

## Specific Farm Tasks: How They Perform

### **Tomato Harvesting (Heavy Use)**
**Performance**: Outstanding. Clean cuts that don't damage the vine or neighboring fruit. The angled blade design makes it easy to reach stems in dense foliage.

**Efficiency**: Much faster than twisting fruit off by hand, and better for plant health.

### **Herb Cutting**
**Performance**: Perfect for delicate herbs like basil and cilantro. No crushing that causes premature wilting.

**Precision**: Small enough for detailed work, sharp enough for clean cuts.

### **Small Tree Pruning**
**Performance**: Handles branches up to about 3/4 inch diameter cleanly. Beyond that, I reach for loppers.

**Limitation**: Not designed for heavy pruning, but perfect for detail work and small corrections.

### **General Farm Tasks**
**Versatility**: I've used these to cut twine, open feed bags, harvest vegetables, and countless other daily tasks. They're like a farm Swiss Army knife.

## Comparison to Other Brands

**vs. Fiskars**: Similar cutting performance, but WORKPRO feels more durable and costs less.

**vs. Felco**: Felco is the gold standard, but costs 3x as much. For most farm tasks, these WORKPRO shears perform 90% as well at 30% of the price.

**vs. Big Box Store Brands**: Night and day difference in build quality and blade retention.

## What I Like Most

1. **Value**: Excellent performance at a reasonable price point
2. **Reliability**: Never failed when I needed them
3. **Comfort**: Can use all day without hand fatigue
4. **Versatility**: Handles 90% of my daily cutting tasks
5. **Easy maintenance**: Simple to clean and sharpen

## What Could Be Better

1. **Blade coating**: The non-stick coating has worn off in spots, though it doesn't affect performance
2. **Holster**: Would love a better belt holster option (the basic one works but isn't great)
3. **Replacement parts**: Not sure about parts availability for long-term maintenance

## Zone 6a Considerations

**Cold weather performance**: Work fine in cold temperatures - no brittleness or stiffness in the mechanism.

**Wet conditions**: Grip stays secure even when wet from morning dew or rain.

**Seasonal storage**: I clean and oil them before winter storage, and they come out ready to work in spring.

## Maintenance Tips

**Daily**: Wipe clean after use, especially if cutting diseased plants
**Weekly**: Quick spray with WD-40 on the pivot point
**Monthly**: Detailed cleaning and blade inspection
**Seasonally**: Proper sharpening and deep cleaning

## The Bottom Line

After 18 months of daily farm use, these [WORKPRO pruning shears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DMV6F4WL/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3P56LYOG94570&psc=1) have earned a permanent place in my tool kit. They're not the most expensive option, but they deliver professional-level performance at a price that makes sense for working farmers.

**Would I buy them again?** Absolutely. In fact, I keep a backup pair in the barn.

**Who should buy these?**
- Market gardeners who need reliable daily-use shears
- Homesteaders managing diverse cutting tasks
- Anyone wanting professional performance without premium pricing
- Farmers who are hard on tools and need durability

**Who might want something else?**
- Professional arborists (need specialized heavy-duty tools)
- Casual gardeners who only prune occasionally (might prefer lighter options)
- Those wanting the absolute best regardless of cost (Felco is still king)

**My rating: 4.5/5 stars** - Excellent value and performance with minor room for improvement.

These shears prove that you don't need to spend a fortune to get tools that work hard and last. Sometimes the best tool is the one that just works, day after day, without fuss or failure.
