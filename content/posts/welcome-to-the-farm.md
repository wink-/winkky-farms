Welcome to Winkky Farms, where Uncle Dick's innovative farming legacy meets modern sustainable practices.

## Our Story

Winkky Farms began in 1980 when Uncle Dick Winkky looked at this land and saw possibility. What started with innovative pig farming and community partnerships has evolved into a modern homestead operation that feeds our family and our community.

Uncle Dick built this farm on the principles of innovation, sustainability, and community connection. After decades of raising Swedish-style pigs and working with local farmers, he surprised everyone by retiring to pursue ballroom dancing. Now it's our turn to carry on his innovative tradition while looking toward the future.
