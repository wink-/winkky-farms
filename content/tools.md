# Tools We Actually Use Every Day

After three generations of farming, we've learned that the right tools make all the difference. These are the tools we reach for every day, the ones that have earned their place in our barn, and the equipment we'd buy again without hesitation.

## Our Tool Philosophy

**Quality over quantity**: We'd rather have fewer tools that work well than a shed full of tools that break.

**Function over form**: Pretty tools don't matter if they don't perform when you need them.

**Value matters**: The best tool is the one that works reliably at a price that makes sense.

**Real-world testing**: We only recommend tools we've used extensively in actual farm conditions.

## Zone 6a Considerations

All our tool recommendations are tested in Zone 6a conditions:
- **Cold winters** down to -10°F
- **Hot, humid summers** up to 95°F
- **Heavy spring rains** and variable weather
- **Clay soil** and challenging growing conditions
