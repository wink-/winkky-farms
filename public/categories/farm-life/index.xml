      <title>Morning Chores: The Best Part of My Day</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;530-am-and-all-is-well&#34;&gt;5:30 AM and All is Well&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The alarm goes off, but I&amp;rsquo;m already awake. Farm life does that to you - your body learns the rhythm of the land, the needs of the animals, the pull of responsibility that never sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slip out of bed, trying not to wake Sarah (though she usually stirs anyway - twenty years of marriage to a farmer teaches you to sleep light). The coffee&amp;rsquo;s already programmed from last night. First cup goes in the travel mug, second cup stays warm for when I come back in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find stories from our fields, updates on our crops and livestock, and insights into the rhythms of farm life that mark each passing season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-youll-find-here&#34;&gt;What You&amp;rsquo;ll Find Here&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ðŸŒ¾ Crop Reports&lt;/strong&gt;: Updates on what we&amp;rsquo;re planting, growing, and harvesting throughout the year&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Farmhouse Kitchen Renovation: Where Tradition Meets Function</title>
      <link>https://winkkyfarms.com/projects/kitchen-renovation/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-heart-of-our-home-gets-a-makeover&#34;&gt;The Heart of Our Home Gets a Makeover&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For thirty years, our kitchen has been the command center of Winkky Farms. It&amp;rsquo;s where we plan the day over morning coffee, where the kids do homework while I prep dinner, where we process the garden harvest, and where three generations gather for Sunday meals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But after three decades of farm life, it was time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-now&#34;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision wasn&amp;rsquo;t made lightly. Farm families don&amp;rsquo;t renovate on a whim - we make do, we repair, we adapt. But when the 1990s laminate countertops started peeling and the cabinet doors wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay closed anymore, we knew it was time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raising Farm Kids: Lessons from the Barn to the Classroom</title>
      <link>https://winkkyfarms.com/posts/farm-kids/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;growing-up-with-dirt-under-their-nails&#34;&gt;Growing Up with Dirt Under Their Nails&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emma is 8 and Jake is 16, and they&amp;rsquo;re growing up in a world that&amp;rsquo;s very different from the one Bill and I knew as kids. But some things about farm life remain beautifully unchanged - the lessons, the values, and the connection to something bigger than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what it really means to raise kids on a farm in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Morning Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before most kids their age are even awake, our children have chores. Not because we&amp;rsquo;re mean parents, but because 23 head of cattle and 50 chickens don&amp;rsquo;t care that it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday morning or summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deck Repair: A Father-Son Summer Project</title>
      <link>https://winkkyfarms.com/projects/deck-repair/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-just-a-few-boards-becomes-a-full-rebuild&#34;&gt;When &amp;ldquo;Just a Few Boards&amp;rdquo; Becomes a Full Rebuild&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started innocently enough. Sarah mentioned that a couple of deck boards were getting soft. &amp;ldquo;Just replace a few boards,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than a weekend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three months later, we had essentially rebuilt the entire deck. Here&amp;rsquo;s how a simple repair project taught us about planning, patience, and the value of doing things right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-discovery&#34;&gt;The Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we thought was a few bad boards turned out to be a much bigger problem. When we started pulling up the obviously damaged planks, we found:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Barn Electrical Upgrade: Bringing the 1950s into the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://winkkyfarms.com/projects/electrical-upgrade/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-safety-meets-necessity&#34;&gt;When Safety Meets Necessity&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The barn that Great-Grandpa Joe built in 1952 has served us well for seven decades. But the electrical system he installed? That was becoming a serious safety concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When our insurance inspector pointed out the fire hazards lurking in our wiring, we knew it was time for a complete electrical overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-wake-up-call&#34;&gt;The Wake-Up Call&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started with a routine insurance inspection. The agent took one look at our barn&amp;rsquo;s electrical system and said, &amp;ldquo;This needs to be updated before we can renew your policy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Winter Planning: Dreaming and Scheming for the Year Ahead</title>
      <link>https://winkkyfarms.com/posts/winter-planning/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-quiet-season&#34;&gt;The Quiet Season&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snow covers the fields, the equipment sits idle in the shed, and the pace of farm life slows to something almost resembling normal. But don&amp;rsquo;t let the quiet fool you - winter is when some of our most important work happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is planning season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-kitchen-table-becomes-mission-control&#34;&gt;The Kitchen Table Becomes Mission Control&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every January, our kitchen table disappears under a pile of seed catalogs, equipment brochures, soil test results, and last year&amp;rsquo;s records. This is where we plan the coming year, dream about improvements, and make the decisions that will shape our next growing season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
