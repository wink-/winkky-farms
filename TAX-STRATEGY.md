## üí° Low-Risk Strategies

### **Start Small, Scale Smart**
1. **Test markets first** - Try farmers market before building farm stand
2. **Validate growing kits** - Make 10-20 kits before bulk production
3. **Start with one class type** - Perfect it before adding more
4. **Use existing infrastructure** - Minimize upfront investment

### **Diversification Benefits**
- **Weather protection** - If crops fail, classes still generate income
- **Seasonal balance** - Different revenue streams peak at different times
- **Risk mitigation** - Multiple small streams vs. one large dependency

### **Efficiency Focus**
- **Batch production** - Make growing kits in bulk
- **Seasonal timing** - Align classes with natural farm calendar
- **Cross-promotion** - Class attendees buy kits and produce

## üìà Year 2 Strategy

### **Refinement Goals**
- **Improve what worked** in Year 1
- **Eliminate what didn't** work efficiently

- **Maintain $10,000+ minimum** for tax qualification

### **Potential Improvements**
- **Higher-value crops** based on Year 1 learning

- **Agritourism** (farm tours) for additional revenue

## üí∞ The Bottom Line

**This is a very achievable goal.** Many small farms reach $10,000 in sales with much less planning than you have. Your three-generation farming knowledge, beautiful website, and strategic approach give you significant advantages.

**Key to success**: Start simple, track everything, and focus on what works in your specific situation and community.

**The property tax savings alone** will likely justify this effort, and you'll build a foundation for future growth if you choose to expand.
